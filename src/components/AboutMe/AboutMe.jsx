          <h2>I am a junior web developer aspiring to become a full stack developer. 
            With a strong foundation in frontend languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, as well as some backend languages like Python and Java, I aim to create dynamic and user-friendly online experiences.
            I'm familiar with some essential web development toolkits like MongoDB, SQL, Git, and other toolkits such as scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas for web-scraping.
            Eager to gain real-world experience, I'm a fast learner who thrives in dynamic environments and embraces new technologies. 
            My goal is to grow as a programmer, collaborate effectively within teams, and build remarkable web applications that make a positive impact. </h2>
